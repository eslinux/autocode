1.If you have Excel in your task bar and if you have several open excel files:
	When you hover the Excel icon in task bar you will see the open excel files in either of 2 ways:
	- Rectangles displayed horizontally.
	- Vertical list of open files.
	I want #2, but somehow am seeing #1.  It makes me crazy when I have 30+ excel files open at the same time!
