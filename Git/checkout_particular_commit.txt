Use git log to find the revision you want to rollback to, and take note of the commit hash. After that, you have 2 options:
	- If you plan to commit anything after that revision, I recommend you to checkout to a new branch: 
	  git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <hash>
	- f you don't plan to commit anything after that revision, you can simply checkout without a branch: 
	  git checkout <hash>
